Project name : Health Ai Suite — Intelligent Analytics for Patient Care



Problem statement:

Machine Learning:

Risk Stratification (Classification) - Predating target - High risk or low risk
Length of Stay Prediction (Regression) - Predict how long the patient will stay
Patient Segmentation (Clustering) - group the patients.
Medical Associations (Association Rules) - suggesting the patient to the new dices will come


Data Collection for ML: 

Risk Stratification - this needs a initial stage of prediction using the patients basic info and their basic lab test info.
